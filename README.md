## Video Poker Mobile App

This mobile app is currently in development. This was made as a practice project to get experience working on React Native, as well as sharpen my algorithm writing skills by calculating winning hands. I also am including javascript classes for all of the functional game logic, since I've mainly put my focus on splitting my javascript code into functions in the past. I am not following any set guide or tutorial of any kind to structure this project or aid the development in any way.

Currently I am focusing on only double double bonus poker, but I plan to expand to other types of video poker games. The algorithms for calculating winning hands are passing all tests currently, but my plan is to keep refactoring them to improve the programs overall speed, as well as finding creative ways to clean up my code and remove any redundant checks on each hand of cards.

The goal by the end of this project is to release this app and make it available for others to play.

# TO DOs
0. FIX JACKS OR BETTER BUG
1. Continue cleaning up/improving the winning hand algorithms
2. Test for more edge cases with each hand
3. Add a system for tracking fake money/changing bet amounts
4. Improve styling/design for a better user experience
5. Add other types of video poker games to chose from
6. Potentially some system for purchasing in-game money, but I definitely don't want this to devolve into similar apps of this nature with slow reload times or users having to watching advertisements for more in-game money.
